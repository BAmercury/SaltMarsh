Brainstorm/Key Ideas I want
Ghost Pirates
Kraken/Big monster battle
Ships and exploring
Fighting pirates and smugglers
Salt-marsh as a home base/important town
Naval Orientated Space
Sahuagin invasion still a big part of the campaign
Lots of aquatic beings
Prehaps we fight pirates, then to realize the sahagin invasion is coming maybe we unite with pirates and smugglers to take down this larger threat?
Control of the ocean
Should we keep Lizardfolk in there and the uniting part from the book?
What do the Sahaguins want with salt-marsh? Maybe it was a religious location for them and they wish to reclaim it?
Something tieing in Ghosts?
howtobeagreatGM suggests that we use a Ghost behind the scenes who has been wronged by saltmarsh to drive the story

Undead captain or something rides a kraken? Undead kraken?

Captain wants to take over saltmarsh bc of previous problems.


Loud vs Unseen nemesis? Blunt force tramua nemesis? Final boss they must fight at the end of the campagin?


So we're given an unseen enemy. Maybe I change it so the Scarlet Brotherhood wants the Sahagin to invade bc they believe it's their birthright? What drives the brotherhood to want to do this?


Saltmarsh is not well defended. The book tells us this. The book also has the PCs gather defenses for salt-marsh land and sea


For sea not really, but maybe I can send the PCs off to the Sea of Princes to aid them in defending salt-marsh


I want saltmarsh to be more of like a town that got caught in the middle sort of situation


Giving the players a ship they can care for gives them a reason to be at sea. Otherwise they would just run on land and avoid the sea monsters

What were the Sahaguin doing out in the first mission? Maybe they were scouting the seas

They are amphibias creatures so they aren't as well versed in sea affairs as humans.

Humans traveled the worlds by sea


How to die Haunted house to sahagin? The captors?


Do I keep the lizardfolk alliance adventure? How do they know about the sahagin incursion


Hail Hydra?

The Sahagins have sent scouts into Salt-marsh disguised as humans?

Hautned house - Good Captain's brother dies trying to investigate whats going on
Maybe the slavers are actually sahagin? 

Hold of Sea princes are being framed by the sahagins so the humans will do infighting as they can take over keoland

Ghost pirates (people who have been wronged by the people of keoland) are allied with the Sahagins to give them more ship authority


They can either ally with the pirates or put them back in their place

It's a question of ocean dominancy not allyship. The PCs should be motivated to take over and conquer the ocean. Explore and chart the ocean and raise up a navy to keep the sahagins in check?


I want Gods in the game as well. Who does Procan ally with?
Sahuagins are not followers of Procan. Humans are as bc they have churches dedicated to Procan on land

If Humans rule the oceans already, what gives the Sahaguin an edge? Raising a navy of the undead.


There is this ocean phenomena - the ghost current. Which allows the Sahagin to bring back the dead and let the ghost pirates ride that current

Necromantic energy to current He calls it the black tide

There have been ghost pirate sightings all over the Azure sea

The Sahagin is unseen villian, working through the black tide
PCs need to figure out that the sahagin are behind this natural phenomena
and then they need to raise an army to defeat them

So the Sahagin have mastered large aquatic monsters and the undead

The pcs will raise an army of land based creatures and its a fight for the Azure sea

Keoland cannot give Naval support just yet. Reinforcements will arrive but it might be too late for them to get all the way down to salt marsh within 60 days


Once Players get their new ship they should make a creed and rank structure and then vow to save Salt marsh. Their bonded to their word by the people of Salt marsh and Anders

I could actually adapt a lot of lore form the Forgotten realms wiki

Sahaugin actually worship the Shark god. Maybe the actual war is between Procan and the Shark God.

The Sahaugin King is a demigod of the Shark God

The point of the Forgetten realms is that "there was something else there before"

The Sahaugin were in Saltmarsh before centuries ago

------------------------------ 
 There's a bit more information here:

https://eventyrgames.com/2019/06/20/ghosts-of-saltmarsh-in-forgotten-realms-free-maps/

I used that blog post in my game and it's done wonders for my game. It's one of the most logical places to put the town, and the other suggestions from that post are quite helpful.

And if you are planning on running this game, one thing I've found is that depending on your playgroup, they may well wish to take that old haunted manor and turn it into a base of operations. If your players do want to do this, I recommend taking them up on it for sure. What I did is had Saltmarsh grant them the deed in return for shutting down the smuggling operation. The haunted manor does have docks and a hidden smuggler's cove, which makes it perfect for the PCs.

To be honest, I'd honestly recommend offering them the manor's deed as a reward even if they don't bring it up themselves. The manor makes a fantastic money-sink for those DMs (like me) who have a habit of giving out too much treasure. Plus it gives them a much bigger stake in things when you get to the Final Enemy. I've got some actual rules on how to upgrade and pay for the manor house if you have an interest.

Some other modifications I made in my game:

I changed the Temple to a Temple of Valkur, but Selune would also work well. Might consider making it a joint temple. Valkur is the closest analog to Procan in the realms.
I kept the Traditionalists mostly as they were in the book, not much needs changing.
The Loyalists I changed to the Lord's Alliance. I gave them strong ties to Waterdeep.
The Scarlet Brotherhood was changed to the Zhentarim and I made them slightly less antagonistic as well and more focused on making money.
I ditched the Dwarven Mine angle in the adventure, as it's honestly not referenced all that much. Instead I put in a grove of magical trees in the Mere of Dead men. The trees are very valuable for wands and ships. Instead of dwarves for the mine, I made it elves who wanted to safely harvest the trees. I also put in a faction of firbolg in the mere who had problems with harvesting, creating a social problem for the players.
I made Keledek a Red Wizard.
I changed the Faithful Quartermasters of Iuz to the Merchants of Waukeen. It makes them less antagonistic and grey area, but it fits the setup better.
The Sea Grove of Obad-Hai becomes the Sea Grove of Eldath, though it's also dedicated to Silvanus.
The Stand Stones are actually dedicated to Umberlee. I had a small faction of hidden cultists in the town who secretly sacrifice a few visitors a year to Umberlee to ensure good fishing. This makes for a tense investigation adventure if the PCs want to stop it.
For the Adventure order, I also changed that up. I broke it into two difference sections. The first is dealing with the Smugglers and Sahuagin threat. What I did was go Sinister Secrets > Danger at Dunwater > Homebrew > Salvage Operation > Final Enemy. I also dropped hints very early that the Smugglers in the first adventure were Umberlee worshippers.

Now, the jump from Danger at Dunwater to Final Enemy is a pretty big one. So I padded out Danger at Dunwater a fair bit more. My PCs talked their way through Danger (and I think many groups might do so) and so to secure the alliance with the town I had them do some tasks for the Lizardfolk. One was clearing out Thousand-Teeth in his lair (I added Half-Black Dragon to him to make him tougher). Finding his lair required working with the Firbolg to act as guides (a nice social encounter).

Once they had cleared out Thousand-Teeth, I had the lizardfolk ask them to deal with a tribe of very aggressive bullywugs. I had them raid and take over a small wood elf village, that when cleared, could be given to the firbolg or the elves in town.

This is when you can sneak in Salvage Operation as a nice change of pace. I also used Sharkfin Shipwreck (https://www.dndbeyond.com/posts/441-encounter-of-the-week-sharkfin-shipwreck) to pad it out a bit more. The addition of Sahuagin brings up their danger that will have to be addressed in Final Enemy. I actually suggest running Sharkfin Shipwreck after the salvage operation, as the PCs should be around 5th level by then and adding in more Sahuagin is a good thing.

From there I ran Final Enemy. Given that my party is 6 players, I didn't have to scale it much at all, since it's balanced for 7th. If your party is smaller and book standard, you might have to downgrade things just a little bit.

After that, I went The Sytes > Isle of the Abbey > Tammerauts Fate. The Styes really doesn't need to be such a high level adventure, and I find that Tammerauts Fate is a better campaign capper. At this point I replaced Orcus with Umberlee, as she just fits way better.
